# PROBLEM: Delete N Nodes After M Nodes of a Linked List

You are given the head of a linked list and two integers m and n.
Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way:
* Start with the head as the current node.
* Keep the first m nodes starting with the current node.
* Remove the next n nodes
* Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.
* Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes.

## Example:

### Input: 
* head = [1, 2,3,4,5,6, 7, 8,9,10, 11, 12,13], m = 2, n = 3

### Output: 
* [1,2,6,7,11,12]

### Explanation: 
* Keep the first (m = 2) nodes starting from the head of the linked List (1 ->2)
* Delete the next (n = 3) nodes (3 -â€º 4 -> 5) show in read nodes.
* Continue with the same procedure until reaching the tail of the Linked List.
* Head of the linked list after removing nodes is returned.
